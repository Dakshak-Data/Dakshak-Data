### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Dakshak Patil

#### About Me

As an aspiring Data Analyst currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, I am passionate about working with Machine Learning, SQL, Power BI, Python, and Excel. I am building my skills through hands-on projects that focus on data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. I actively use popular Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to develop solutions and gain deeper insights from data. I am constantly learning and growing, and I look forward to connecting with others who share an interest in Data Science and Analytics. Feel free to explore my repositories to see my latest work!.
